# LumbarAging
Lumbar disc degeneration is a key indicator of aging of the human motor system and is associated with an increase in cases of low back pain worldwide. Current diagnostic methods rely on imaging and physician experience, and lack predictive tools and personalized treatment strategies. This study used a multicenter lumbar MRI dataset to map disc degeneration in a Chinese population, revealing three stages of accelerated degeneration in the life cycle. The age heat map, which highlights the degeneration rates of the L1-L3 segments, is highly synchronized with true age and can be used as a baseline for biological age estimation. The average absolute error of age estimation of the slice set network based on contrast learning is 2.59 years, and its reliability is verified by multi-center. Two new digital biomarkers, age Delta and Age Selta, are proposed for predicting physiologic and pathological lumbar aging and have been preliminatively validated in long-term clinical cases. This research provides insights into spinal degeneration and supports personalized precision medicine.
